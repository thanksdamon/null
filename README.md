I'm Damon Collins and I'm a computer science student. I'm assuming all of you either were or are as well. My intentions with this site are unclear as of now but I'm hoping to have some really interesting projects of my own here so I don't have to watch everyone else have fun! Things that are currently super interesting to me are machine learning, quantumcomputing, and robotics. All things way out of my scope of understanding so far, but willing to put in the work! I know a little bit of Python and Java, but nothing else. I have a strong desire to learn more though.
